    </head>


    <body>
        <p>Back when they just started out, the company that theyâ€™re with, BigHit Entertainment, was almost on the brink of bankruptcy 
        so they had a lot of difficult times but BTS pulled through all the difficulties and are now worldwide famous. 
        They truly never gave up on their dreams.</p>

        <p>To me, BTS is very inspirational and they continue to inspire others through their music.
        I love how all their songs have powerful meanings. BTS always makes me smile. Whenever I have a bad day, I can watch content 
        them and I will instantly feel better. They are my happy pill.</p>
