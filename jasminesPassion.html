        <h1>BTS</h1>

        <p>BTS is a K-pop boy group composed of 7 members: RM, Jin, Suga, J-hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook. 
        They are extremely talented and humble even though they are pretty worldwide famous now. 
        This year is their 7th year anniversary since they debuted back in June 2013. 
        Like RM said they’re still the same boys from seven years ago, still the same people who are chasing after their dreams.</p>
        
        <p>Back when they just started out, the company that they’re with, BigHit Entertainment, was almost on the brink of bankruptcy 
        so they had a lot of difficult times but BTS pulled through all the difficulties and are now worldwide famous. 
        They truly never gave up on their dreams.</p>

        <p>To me, BTS is very inspirational and they continue to inspire others through their music.
        I love how all their songs have powerful meanings. BTS always makes me smile. Whenever I have a bad day, I can watch content 
        them and I will instantly feel better. They are my happy pill.</p>
